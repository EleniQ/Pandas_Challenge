# Pandas_Challenge
For this task I have taken two CSVs named "schools complete" and "students complete" and merged them into one dataframe. These can be found within the "Resources" folder.

From this dataframe I have extracted all other data. 
Topics covered include:
  Dataframe Merging,
   GroupBy,
   Dataframe formatting,
   Binning
  
### Additional Comments 
My thought process commentary is included within the code itself. I have left this in so you can see the natural process I took to complete this task. 
A brief analysis is included at the bottom of this code in markdown format.
